<h1 style="text-align:left">Hi, I'm Tudor</h1>

I'm a software developer from Moldova. Most of the time, I write Python, and in my free time I try to experiment with new programming languages like Go, Vala. Also I enjoy reading in my free time. I try to allocate at least 30 minutes daily to read. The list of books I have read is available on the <a class="link" href="{{ site.url }}/books">Books</a> page of this website.
Feel free to hit me with anything that you think I will find it interesting.

I am not much of a writer, but I'll try to write something in the blog section of this website, about things I find interesting.

Here is what I am doing <a class="link" href="{{ site.url }}/now">now</a>.
